# Trees and Graphs
A tree is just a graph with no cycles
A graph needs a visited set to track where you've been

Breadth First Search
Its an alg used to explore nodes in a graph tree level by level
Starts at a given node and explores all neighbours, then neighbours neighbours, etc
BFS uses a queue to decide which node to explore
Best for shortest path

GRAPH BFS: [[Python Graph BFS]]

Depth First Search
Goes as deep as possible in one path before going to the next node
Uses stack (recursion)
Best for exploring all paths

TREE DFS: [[Python Tree DFS]]

DFS RECURSIVE: [[Python Recursive DFS]]

DFS ITERATIVE: [[Python Iterative DFS]]


Heaps
Min heap - smallest value is the root and each parent is smaller than its children
max heap - largest is at the root

opposite to find k largest/smallest
